# stone-paper-scissor-game
I built a simple Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to compete against the computer by selecting rock, paper, or scissors. The computer's choice is randomly generated, and the scores update in real-time. A message displays the outcome of each round.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Skills Demonstrated: Game logic, DOM manipulation, Event handling
